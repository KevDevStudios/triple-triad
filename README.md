# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Triple Triad - Card Game with Gameplay Recording 🎮

A beautiful implementation of the classic Triple Triad card game featuring:
- 🃏 30 unique monster cards with element-based graphics
- 🎵 Background music and sound effects
- 🎥 **Gameplay recording** to capture and share your matches
- 🤖 AI opponents with three difficulty levels
- ✨ Stunning visual effects and animations

### 🎥 Recording Your Gameplay

The game includes a built-in recording feature that allows you to capture your gameplay:
1. Click the **🎥 Record** button in the top-left corner during gameplay
2. Play your game as normal - all actions are being recorded
3. Click **⏹️ Stop** when you're finished
4. Click **💾 Download** to save your gameplay video

The recording uses your browser's built-in screen capture API, so no external software is needed!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
